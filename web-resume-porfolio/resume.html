     <p>As a Cyber Security Summer Analyst at Accenture, I am interested in building on my knowledge with Threat/Risks Modeling, Vulnerability Management and Response & Recovery. I believe that I will be a great contribution as a Cyber Security Analyst at Accenture, as I am very curious about Cybersecurity Architecture, Engineering, Governance and Operations Accenture incorporates.
      Currently I am a Computer Science Senior at Benedictine University studying Bachelors in Computer Science slated to graduate in Spring (May) 2023. I am inquisitive energetic with a strong foundation in math, programming logic, and cross-platform coding. Seeking to leverage development skills as an intern for a leading technology organization.
